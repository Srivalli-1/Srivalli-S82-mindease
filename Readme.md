# MindEase: AI-Powered Emotional Support Companion

## Project Overview
MindEase is an AI-powered conversational agent designed to provide emotional support, detect mood changes, suggest coping strategies, and connect users to professional help when needed. It acts as a supportive companion but does not replace a therapist. The goal is to create a safe space for users to express their emotions and receive personalized responses and resources.

## Features

### ✅ Core Features
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Understands user input (text or voice).
   - Detects emotional tone (e.g., happy, sad, anxious).

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyzes messages for mood detection using pre-trained models like VADER, TextBlob, or BERT-based models.

3. **Personalized Responses**:
   - Provides empathetic replies based on user input.
   - Example: If the user says, "I feel lonely," the bot replies with empathy: "I’m here for you. Want to talk about what’s making you feel lonely?"

4. **Mood Tracking**:
   - Logs daily moods and displays trends (e.g., "You felt anxious 3 times this week").

5. **Resource Suggestions**:
   - Offers breathing exercises, motivational quotes, or meditation guides.
   - Integrates YouTube links or embedded audio for relaxation.

6. **Emergency Support**:
   - Detects mentions of self-harm or suicide and suggests helplines.
